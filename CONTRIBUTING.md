# About contributing to EPITECH C/C++ Headers

First of all, Thank you for wanting to contribute to this extension.  
It was a little project I made and I didn't expected to see the adoption it got from the VSCode marketplace.  

Now we have a few thousands downloads and we might open up to contributions from the community.  
So here are the guidelines on how you can contribute to the project and setup the development environment.  

## Setup installation

If you want to fix a bug and submit a pull request, you might want to first fork this repository.  
Then clone it locally using the git cli tool, Github Desktop Client or any git client.  
Enter the "epitech-c-cpp-headers" folder and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run compile #for one time compile
npm run compile-watch #for automatic background compile upon file save
```

After those steps, run:
```bash
code .
```
to start VSCode in the current directory.

You can then edit the files as you want and launch a VSCode instance with the result by launching the "Launch Extension" Debug config in the Debug tab (or press F5).

A new VSCode instance shall open with your new extension preloaded inside of it.

## Submitting a pull request

When you finish editing the code, you can submit it by commiting and pushing it to your forked repository.  
Then go the forked repository's Github page and a button "Submit Pull Request" should be visible.  
You can click it to go to the description redaction of your pull request.  
You have everything you need to complete the pull request from there.
